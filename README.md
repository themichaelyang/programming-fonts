# Programming fonts ‚≠êÔ∏è

This is my collection of high quality programming fonts.

If you're on a Mac, you can install these fonts quickly and also get SF Mono by running:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/themichaelyang/programming-fonts.git
$ cd programming-fonts
$ chmod +x install.sh
$ ./install.sh
```

This will copy over SF Mono into the ```San-Francisco-Mono``` directory and then also load all the font families in this repo into Font Book, so you can pick and choose which fonts you'd like to install.

If you're on Windows, you should get a mac and install using the instructions above. üòô

## Notes about the fonts

This repo comes with several fonts and their popular variants.

- [**Fira Code**](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) is Fira Mono but with programming ligatures.
- **InconslataGo** is Inconsolata but with straight quotation marks.
- **SF Mono** isn't included in the repo due to licensing, but can be copied in and installed using the included script on macOS.
- **Office Code Pro D** is Office Code Pro but with a dotted zero.
- **Menlo** does not have a license, but should be okay to use. It is based on DejaVu Sans Mono, which is also included (and does have a license).

I also recommend taking a look at [**Input**](http://input.fontbureau.com/), which is highly customizable and free to use, but proprietary (which is why it wasn't included in this repo).
