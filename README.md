# Programming fonts ‚≠êÔ∏è

This is my collection of high quality programming fonts.

If you're on a Mac, you can get and install these fonts quickly by running:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/themichaelyang/programming-fonts.git
$ cd programming-fonts
$ chmod +x install.sh
$ ./install.sh
```

This will copy the SF Mono files into the ```San-Francisco-Mono``` directory and then load all the font families in this repo into Font Book, so you can choose which fonts you'd like to install.

If you're on Windows, you should get a mac and install using the instructions above. üòô

## Notes about the fonts

This repo comes with several fonts and their popular variants.

- [**Fira Code**](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) is Fira Mono but with programming ligatures.
- **InconslataGo** is Inconsolata but with straight quotation marks.
- **SF Mono** isn't included in the repo due to licensing, but can be copied in and installed using the included script on macOS.
- **Office Code Pro D** is Office Code Pro but with a dotted zero.
- **Menlo** does not have a license, but should be okay to use. It is based on DejaVu Sans Mono, which is also included (and does have a license). It is also included by default with macOS, so it does not have to be installed.

I also recommend taking a look at [**Input**](http://input.fontbureau.com/), which is highly customizable and free for personal use, but proprietary (which is why it wasn't included in this repo).
